Xenia Bot is another General-Purpose Discord Bot for the masses.

The main reason for it's creation is to de-clutter the usage of unnecessary Discord Bots in a server just to use one or two features in a bot (i.e, mee6 for leveling, dyno for moderation, etc...) when you can have all of those features in a single bot.
